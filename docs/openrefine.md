# Open Refine

ESEF data is indexed with [Legal Entity Identifiers (LEIs)](https://www.gleif.org/en/about-lei/introducing-the-legal-entity-identifier-lei). As part of connecting ESEF data to a larger linked data corpus, Wikidata is used to gather additional information. This only works, however, if Wikidata entries contain the LEI.

The first step in connecting ESEF data to Wikidata is checking whether the LEI is available on Wikidata and, if it isn't, updating Wikidata. In order to carry out this data refinement task we use Openrefine.

Wikidata serves as the 'single interface for correction' for this project. In contrast to a 'single source of truth', it does not presume that a perfectly accurate dataset is achievable, but that the best dataset comes from the greatest number of eyeballs, free editing access, and disparately motivated 'check and correct' efforts by many individuals.
